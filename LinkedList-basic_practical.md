Here are some practical exercises to improve your understanding and implementation of Linked Lists in JavaScript. Each exercise comes with a brief description of the task to help you focus on key concepts.

---

### **1. Implement a Singly Linked List**
**Task**: Create a Singly Linked List class with the following methods:
- `append(value)`: Add a new node to the end of the list.
- `prepend(value)`: Add a new node to the beginning of the list.
- `print()`: Print all the elements of the list.

---

### **2. Reverse a Linked List**
**Task**: Write a function to reverse a given singly linked list in place.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`  
Output: `4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`

---

### **3. Detect a Cycle in a Linked List**
**Task**: Implement a function to detect if a linked list has a cycle using the Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 2 (cycle back to 2)`  
Output: `true`

---

### **4. Find the Middle Node**
**Task**: Write a function to find the middle node of a linked list. If the list has an even number of nodes, return the second middle node.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`  
Output: `3`

---

### **5. Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists**
**Task**: Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 3 -> 5` and `2 -> 4 -> 6`  
Output: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6`

---

### **6. Remove Duplicates from a Sorted Linked List**
**Task**: Remove all duplicate nodes from a sorted linked list.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3`  
Output: `1 -> 2 -> 3`

---

### **7. Delete a Node Without Head Reference**
**Task**: Given a reference to a node in a linked list (but not the head), delete that node.  
Example:  
Input: `Node with value 3 in 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`  
Output: `1 -> 2 -> 4`

---

### **8. Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome**
**Task**: Check whether the linked list is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 1`  
Output: `true`

---

### **9. Remove N-th Node from the End**
**Task**: Remove the N-th node from the end of a linked list.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, N = 2  
Output: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`

---

### **10. Intersection of Two Linked Lists**
**Task**: Find the node where two linked lists intersect.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5` and `6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5`  
Output: `4 -> 5`

---

### **11. Sort a Linked List**
**Task**: Write a function to sort a linked list using merge sort or insertion sort.

---

### **12. Flatten a Multilevel Linked List**
**Task**: Flatten a linked list where each node might have a child pointer to another linked list.

---

### **13. Rotate a Linked List**
**Task**: Rotate a linked list to the right by K places.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, K = 2  
Output: `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`

---

### **14. Partition a Linked List**
**Task**: Partition the list around a value x, such that nodes less than x come before nodes greater than or equal to x.  
Example:  
Input: `1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 2`, x = 3  
Output: `1 -> 2 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5`
